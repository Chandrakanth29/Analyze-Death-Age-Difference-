# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference

 "Analysis of death age differences between right-handers and left-handers."
 
1️⃣ Overview
This project explores whether handedness (right-handed vs. left-handed) has an impact on lifespan. 
By analyzing a dataset containing information on age at death and handedness, the study aims to identify patterns and possible differences in longevity.

2️⃣ Goals
Compare the average lifespan of right-handers and left-handers.
Perform statistical analysis to determine if the difference is significant.
Use data visualization to present insights effectively.

3️⃣ Tools & Techniques Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for data analysis Statistical analysis for validation
Data cleaning & preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent data.

4️⃣ Key Findings
The average lifespan of right-handers and left-handers is compared based on real-world data.
Any statistically significant difference is highlighted.
Insights into external factors that may influence lifespan are discussed.
